## Examples

This folder contains example for JavaScript and 5 JS framework/library with 3 different pickers. <br>
I just want to demonstrate how you can use this package, that's why I kept these examples as simple as possible with inline style, and minimum customization, feel free to change the code as you desire (normally I'm NOT recommend to use inline style!).

**_Note That if you using `pure JavaScript` code you need to add few template to your `.html` file, this templates provide for you and can be found in `examples/js/templates` folder._**

## Quick Access To JavaScript Templates

- [DatePicker](./js/templates/DatePicker.md)
- [RangePicker](./js/templates/RangePicker.md)
- [MultiSelect](./js/templates/MultiSelect.md)
